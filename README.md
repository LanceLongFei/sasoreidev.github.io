## Context
This is a classic 'pls test my game on steam before i can release it' scam on Discord. The scammers link to [sasoreidev.github.io](https://web.archive.org/web/20230421224129/https://sasoreidev.github.io/).
As you are able to tell, this is an extremely sloppy website. Just to name a few:
- The website's layout is directly taken from [Playtonic Games](https://www.playtonicgames.com/) when looking into [webcopy-origin.txt](main/webcopy-origin.txt).
- The supposedly beta released game's screenshots are directly taken from Swords and Fairy 7, as an easy reverse image search can already reveal.
- There are several spelling mistakes.
